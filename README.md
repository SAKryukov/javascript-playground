# JavaScript Playground

JavaScript Playground can be used as an advanced calculator. The result of the script execution can be viewed immediately; additionally, the [console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console) object can be used; structured console results can be browsed as it is done in the JavaScript IDE and debuggers.
