[JavaScript Playground](https://SAKryukov.github.io/javascript-playground/JavaScript.Playground) can be used as an advanced [calculator](https://SAKryukov.github.io/javascript-playground/JavaScript.Playground). The result of the script execution can be viewed immediately; additionally, the [console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console) object can be used; structured console results can be browsed as it is done in the JavaScript IDE and debuggers.
